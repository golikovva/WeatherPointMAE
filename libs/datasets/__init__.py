"""Synthetic datasets for WeatherPointMAE.

This package provides simple numpy-based datasets that mimic point-cloud
representations of meteorological variables.  Each dataset yields feature
vectors for a particular variable alongside spatial coordinates.  It also
contains a :class:`FusionDataset` that combines multiple variable datasets
into a unified view.
